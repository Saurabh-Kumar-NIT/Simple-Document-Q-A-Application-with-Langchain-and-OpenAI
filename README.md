📄 Document Q&A Application using LangChain & OpenAI
🚀 Overview
This project is a Generative AI-powered Q&A application that processes documents and answers user queries based on their content using LangChain, OpenAI API, and Vector Databases.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
LangChain
OpenAI API (Embeddings & GPT)
ChromaDB / FAISS (Vector Database)

📂 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Ingestion
Upload and load documents (PDFs, TXT, etc.)
Use LangChain loaders to read document content.

2️⃣ Document Splitting
Split large documents into manageable text chunks.
Tools: CharacterTextSplitter (LangChain).

3️⃣ Embedding Generation
Convert each chunk into vector embeddings using OpenAI Embeddings API.
4️⃣ Vector Database Storage
Store embeddings into a vector database like ChromaDB or FAISS for fast retrieval.

5️⃣ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
For any user query:
Retrieve the most relevant chunks from vector DB.
Feed them into OpenAI’s GPT model via LangChain.
Generate accurate, context-based answers.
